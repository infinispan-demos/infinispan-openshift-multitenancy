= Infinispan with Multi-tenancy @ OpenShift Demo

This demo shows how to deploy Infinispan on OpenShift cluster (with TLS/SNI), and connect to the Grid using Hot Rod client.
The demo will use https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html#secured-routes[Passthrough Route] which will allow clients to connect to it.

The code located in this repository provides implementation for Multi-tenancy blog post, which can be found here: http://blog.infinispan.org/2017/09/multi-tenancy-infinispan-as-service.html

== Prerequisites

For running this demo you will need:

* OpenShift Local Cluster (grab the installation files https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[here])
* https://github.com/johanhaleby/kubetail.git[KubeTail] for observing multiplexed log files from OpenShift
* https://maven.apache.org/[Maven]

== How to run the demo?

* Deploy it on OpenShift local cluster using `./init_infrastructure.sh`
* Look at the logs of `cache-checker`. Notice to what caches it has access to.
* Look at the source of `cache-checker` application.
